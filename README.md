Just a place for things
Speaking of things, I have a few. I also have things I want to do, but there are too many things yet too little time. Maybe if I just stop sleeping...

By the way, here are the things that I like:
1. Having a sense of purpose (things to accomplish)
2. Dreaming about flying
3. Chocolate-peanut butter ice cream
